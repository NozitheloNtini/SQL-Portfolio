 #Project Title: Chinook Analysis 

This project uses the following raw data (https://t.ly/Rp7X1)

Chinook is a fictional Music Store. This project uses SQL Queries to examine data such as the most popular countries for purchases, the top customers, 
and genre preferences, we can gain valuable insights into the business landscape. 
The findings from this analysis will help identify opportunities for marketing strategies, improve customer loyalty, and ultimately drive sales growth.

-- 1. Countries with the most purchases
SELECT BillingCountry, COUNT (BillingCountry) NumberOfOrders
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY NumberOfOrders DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Customers with the most track purchases
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, COUNT(tra.TrackId) AS TotalSongs
FROM chinook.customers cust
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items invoit 
ON inv.InvoiceId = invoit.InvoiceId
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks tra 
ON invoit.TrackId = tra.TrackId
GROUP BY cust.FirstName, cust.LastName;

-- 3. customers globally and their most ordered genres
SELECT gen.Name AS Genre,
cust.FirstName, 
cust.LastName, 
COUNT(invoit.TrackId) AS OrderCount
FROM chinook.customers cust
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv 
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items invoit 
ON inv.InvoiceId = invoit.InvoiceId
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks tra 
ON invoit.TrackId = tra.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.genres gen 
ON tra.GenreId = gen.GenreId
GROUP BY gen.Name, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName
ORDER BY OrderCount DESC; 


-- 4. Artists and their albums
SELECT art.Name, alb.Title
FROM chinook.artists art
INNER JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON art.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId;


-- 5. Total sales in 2010
SELECT ROUND (SUM (Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2010-%';

-- 6. Sales agent with most sales in 2010
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND (sum(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2010-%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;


#How to Run the Queries:
1. Ensure you have access to the chinook database. Link is provided abobe
2. Copy and paste the SQL queries into your SQL environment. I used SQLiteStudio 3.4.4
3. Execute the queries to see the results.

#Technologies Used:
1. SQL
2. SQLiteStudio (query writing and running)

#Business Conclusion

1. By gathering the Top 5 countries with the most orders, we identify our biggest client base. Conversely, by changing the query to (ORDER BY NumberOfOrders ASC) investigations should be down to understand why the countries with the lowest purchases are so. This could be because of pricing, cultural differences, lack of maerketing, etc.
2. Identifying the customers with the highest purchases helps determine loyal customers. With this, we can do a Loyalty Program: if a client reaches a certain number of orders, they receive an incentive. This increases repeat purchases leading to brand/store loyalty.
3. Identifying the most ordered genre helps us to:
        A. Know which music to add to the store, based off the popular genre to guarantee sales
        B. BY changing ordering the query to the customer's names (ORDER BY Firstname), we see which genre each customer purchased most of, allowing is to provide personalised marketing and sales recomendations for each customer
        C. Ensure inventory has the right amount of stock based off customer preferences  
4. The database has the artists and their albums stored separately, joining the two tables helps identify which artists have which songs. 
        Also, it shows artists with multiple songs, with this information, we could do bundles deals. By purchasing a certain number of songs from one artist, they get a discount 
5. By getting the current year's total sales, we can compare to the prevous years, to track for company growth in terms of revenue appreciation/ depreciation
         Looking at sales from a certain year in total then comparing the sales of the top sales agent, helps to highlight the amount of work the agent does to promote the store and music.
6. By identifying the top sales agent, it makes it easier to see which agent is deserving of incentives such as a raise in salary, a promotion, etc
        Changing the query to (ORDER BY TotalSales ASC) will display the sales agant with the lowest sales. This also helps to implement training strategies to ensure sales agent with the least sales grows and improves
