#Project Title: Superstore Analysis
#Project Overview & Purpose: I used SQL to analyse the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. The findings will help identify pricing and marketing strategies and implement inventory control.
#Project Questions:
-- 1. What are the cheapest products?
-- 2. What is the average product rating?
-- 3. What Kitchen Supplies are less than $100?
-- 4. How many Smart LED TVs were sold?


#This project uses the following data:

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),
    (9, 'Air Purifier', 'Appliances', 129.50, 35, 4.6),
    (10, 'Premium Coffee Maker', 'Kitchen Supplies', 79.99, 50, 4.9),
    (11, 'Ergonomic Office Chair', 'Furnishings', 189.00, 20, 4.5),
    (12, 'Wireless Earbuds', 'Electronics', 49.99, 75, 4.3),
    (13, 'Slow Cooker', 'Appliances', 49.95, 30, 4.7),
    (14, 'Cutlery Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 34.50, 40, 4.4),
    (15, 'Cozy Throw Blanket', 'Furnishings', 24.99, 100, 4.2);


-- 1. Order items by price
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;


-- 2. Statistic about the item prices
SELECT COUNT(average_rating) avg_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.50;


-- 3. Statistic about the price for items in a certain category
SELECT MIN(price) Price
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies';


-- 4. Statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies"
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
WHERE price <100
ORDER BY price desc;


-- 5. SQL Query that will show how many Smart LED TVs were bought
SELECT COUNT(item_name)
FROM superstore 
WHERE item_name = "Smart LED TV";


#How to Run the Queries:
1. Ensure you have access to the superstore database. This is the link https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/PvBAaQwEUSWAxZCsg4Vmx/0
2. Copy and paste the SQL queries into a SQL environment. I recommend DBFiddle
3. Execute the queries to see the results.


#Technologies Used:
1. SQL
2. DBFiddle (for online SQL testing and sharing)


#Business Conclusion:
1. The product pricing strategy can be evaluated to ensure it's competitive. Identifying the cheapest and most expensive products can inform pricing decisions.
2. Top-rated products can be promoted more aggressively to increase sales. Products with high ratings can be used to improve customer satisfaction.
3. This information can help set competitive prices for similar products. Identifying affordable options in popular categories can help create marketing strategies.
4. This information can help create targeted promotions or discounts. Identifying affordable options can inform product bundle strategies.
5. Sales performance can inform inventory management and restocking decisions.
