#Business Conclusions
1. Identifying artists with multiple chart appearances can inform marketing strategies. Featured artists with high frequency can be targeted for collaborations or promotions
2. Artists with multiple songs in the chart can be prioritized for playlist inclusion. This ensures diverse content while leveraging popular artists.
3. Categorising songs by loudness can optimise playlist sequencing. Balancing loudness levels enhances listener engagement.
4. Identifying the fastest songs can inform workout or energy-boosting playlists. High-tempo songs can increase user engagement.
5. Analysing average danceability by artist can guide branding strategies. Artists with high danceability can be marketed for party or club events.
6. Developing artist-specific search functionality can enhance user experience. Quick access to favorite artists' tracks increases customer satisfaction.

Partner with popular artists for exclusive content.
